This file will be used for noteTaking since I was too dumb to bring my notebook lol.

1. The actual game itself:
  Idea 1)
    The game knows the following:
        - Which cells (given on a 2-dimensional axis plane, aka given the x, y coordinates) contain mines.
        - How wide and tall the board is, so a given input will be known if it is out of bounds or not.
    This way, only the cells that have mines will be stored.

  Idea 2)
    The game stores a list of all cells, each cell given whether it is a mine or not. This is cumbersome,
    uses a lot of space, so i'm going with Idea 1.

2. Future idea:
  Idea 1)
    Mines won't be generated until the first tile is clicked, this is to prevent players from experiencing
    failure immedietaly after hitting a tile, as that would be pretty unfair

  Idea 2)
    Automatically click connected tiles if said tile does not have nearby mines.


Notes: 2022/05/17:
  The minefield axis works similar to an upside down x-y axis, with going left increasing the x-axis, and down increasing
  the y-axis. So for example tile (2,3) would be the third tile to the right, and fourth tile down, starting from
  the top-left tile.
