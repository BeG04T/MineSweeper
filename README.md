# MineSweeper

This is a very simple minesweeper game i made for personal projects. You can play or test it out by simply:
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Open index.html on any browser you use!

Current state:
    The game current only has a 5 by 5 board with 1 mine on it, so not much of a challenge, but I plan on at least adding more mines, a bigger board, and different difficulties. Maybe even some of the features in the original minesweeper such as flags!
